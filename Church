Colossians 1:15-20
  15 He is the image of the invisible God,
    the firstborn over all creation.
  16 For by Him all things were created
    that are in heaven and that are on earth,
    visible and invisible,
    whether thrones or dominions
    or principalities or powers.
    All things were created through Him and for Him.
  17 And He is before all things,
    and in Him all things consist.
  18 And He is the head of the body,
    the church,
    who is the beginning,
    the firstborn from the dead,
    that in all things He may have the preeminence.


*1 Corinthians 12:12-13
  12 For as the body is one and has many members,
      but all the members of that one body, being many, are one body
      so also is Christ.
  13 For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body
      - whether Jews or Greeks,
        whether slaves or free -
      and have all been made to drink into one Spirit.

  14 For in fact the body is not one member but many.


Matthew 16:18
    <<...
  18   And I also say to you that you are Peter,
      and on this rock I will build My church,
      and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it.
    ...>>


Ephesians 4:4-6
  4 There is one body and one Spirit,
    just as you were called in one hope of your calling;
  5 one LORD, one faith, one baptism;
  6 one God and Father of all,
    who is above all,
    and through all,
    and in you all.


Ephesians 4:11-16
  11 And He Himself gave 
    some to be apostles,
    some prophets,
    some evangelists,
    and some pastors and teachers,
  12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry,
    for the edifying of the body of Christ,
  13 till we all come to the unity of the faith 
    and of the knowledge of the Son of God,
    to a perfect man,
    to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ;
  14 that we should no longer be children,
    tossed to and fro
    and carried about with every wind of doctrine,
    by the trickery of men,
    in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting,
  15 but, speaking the truth in love,
    may grow up in all things to Him who is the head
    - Christ -
  16 from whom the whole body, 
    joined and knit together 
    by what every joint supplies,
    according to the effective working 
    by which every part does its share,
    causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love.

Hebrews 10:23-25
  23 Let us hold fast the confession of our hope 
    without wavering [weakening/faltering],
    for He who promised is faithful.
  24 And let us consider one another 
    in order to stir up love and good works,
        [Acts 2:42]
          42 And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship,
              in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.
  25 not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together,
    as is the manner of some,
    but exhorting [encourage] one another, 
        [Romans 13:11]
          10 Love does no harm to a neighbor;
              therefore love is the fulfillment of the law.
          11 And do this, knowing the time, that now it is high time
              to awake out of sleep;
              for now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed.
          12  The night is far spent, the day is at hand.
              Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness,
              and let us put on the armor of light.
    and so much more as you see the Day approaching. 
        [Phillipians 4:4]
            4 Rejoice in the LORD always.
              Again I will say, rejoice!

//Offering
2 Corinthians 8:1-5
  1 Moreover, brethren, we make known to you 
    the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia:
  2 that in a great trial of affliction 
    the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty 
    abounded in the riches of their liberality [giving/spending freely].
  3 For I bear witness that 
    according to their ability, yes, and beyond their ability,
    they were freely willing,
  4 imploring us with much urgency that 
    we would receive the gift
    and the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.
  5 And not only as we had hoped,
    but they first gave themselves to the LORD,
    and then to us by the will of God.

  6 So we urged Titus, that as he had begun,
    so he would also complete this grace in you as well.
  7 But as you abound in everything
    - in faith, 
      in speech, 
      in knowledge, 
      in all diligence, 
      and in your love for us -
    see that you abound in this grace also.

11-12
  10 And in this I give advice:
    It is to your advantage 
    not only to be doing what you began and were desiring to do a year ago;
  
  11 but now you also must complete the doing of it;
    that as there was a readiness to desire it,
    so there also may be a completion out of what you have.
  12 For if there is first a willing mind,
    it is accepted according to what one has,
    and not according to what he does not have.

  13 For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened;
  14 but by an equality, that now at this time 
    your abundance may supply their lack,
    that their abundance also may supply your lack
    - that there may be equality.
  15 As it is written,
      "He who gathered much had nothing left over,
        and he who gathered little had no lack." [Exodus 16:18]

Romans 12:1-
  1 I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God,
    that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God,
    which is your reasonable service.
        [Phillippians 4:18]
          18 Indeed I have all and abound.
            I am full, having received from Epaphroditus 
            the things sent from you,
            a sweet smelling aroma,
            an acceptable sacrifice,
            well pleasing to God.
          19 And my God shall supply all your need 
            according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus.
        [Hebrews 10:18-20]  
          18 Now there is a remission of these,
            there is no longer an offering for sin.
          19 Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus,
          20 by a new and living way which He consecrated for us,
            through the veil,  that is, His flesh,
  2 And do not be conformed to this world,
    but transformed by the renewing of your mind,
    that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.

1 Peter 2:4-5, 
  4 Coming to Him as to a living stone,
    rejected indeed by men,
    but chosen by God and precious,
  5 you also, as living stones,
    are being built up a spiritual house,
    a holy priesthood,
    to offer up spiritual sacrifices 
    acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
- 2:9
  9 But you are a chosen generation,
    a royal priesthood,
    a holy nation,
    His own special people,
    that you may proclaim the praises of Him 
    who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;

  10 who once were not a people
    but are now the people of God,
    who had not obtained mercy
    but now have obtained mercy.

2 Peter 2:20-22
  20 For if, after they have escaped the pollutions of the world 
    through the knowledge of the LORD and Savior Jesus Christ,
    they are again entangled in them and overcome, 
    the latter end is worse for them than the beginning.
  21 For it would have been better for them 
    not to have known the way of righteousness,
    then having known it, 
    to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.
  22 But it has happened to them according to the true proverb:
      "A dog returns to his own vomit,"
    and
      "a sow, having washed, to her wallowing in the mire."
      [Proverbs 26:11]
