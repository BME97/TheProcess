2 Timothy 3:16-17
  16 All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, 
      and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, 
      for correction, for instruction in righteousness,
  17 that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly
      equipped for every good work

Hebrews 4:12-13
  12 For the word of God is living and powerful, 
      and sharper than any two-edged sword,
      piercing even to the division of soul and spirit,
      and of joints and marrow, 
      and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.
  13 And there is no creature hidden from His sight, 
      but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him
      to whom we must give account

John 8:31-32
  31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him,
      << If you abide in My word, 
        you are My disciples indeed.
  32    And you shall know the truth, 
        and the truth shall make you free. >>

Mark 7:1-8
  1 Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes came together to Him, 
    having come from Jerusalem.
  2 Now when they saw some of His disciples eat bread with defiled, 
    that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault.
  3 For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless
    they wash their hands in a special way, 
    holding the tradition of the elders,
  4 When they come from the marketplace, 
    they do not eat unless they wash.
    And there are many other things which they have received and hold,
    like the washing of cups, pitchers, copper vessels, and couches.
  5 Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him,
    "Why do Your disciples not walk according 
    to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?"
  6 He answered and said to them,
    << Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written:
        'This people honors Me with their lips,
          But their heart is far from Me.
  7       And in vain they worship Me,
          Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'
  8   For laying aside the commandment of God, 
      you hold the tradition of men - the washing of pitchers 
      and cups, and many other such things you do. >>

John 12:46-48
  <<...
  46  I have come as a light into the world,
      that whoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness.
  47  And if anyone hears My words and does not believe,
      I do not judge him; 
      for I did not come to judge the world
      but to save the world
  48  He who rejects Me, 
      and does not receive My words,
      has that which judges him - 
      the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day.

1 Timothy 4:16
  16 Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine.
      Continue in them, for in doing this
      you will save yourself and those who hear you.

Psalms 119

  119:10
  10 With my whole heart I have sought You;
    Oh, let me not wander from Your commandments!

// Why Word / Bible / book of John is written
John 20:30-31
  30 And truly Jesus did many others signs 
      in the presence of His disciples,
      which are not written in this book;
  31  but these are written that 
      you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God,
      and that believing you may have life in His name.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Matthew 22:29
  29 Jesus answered and said to them,
    << You are mistaken, 
      not knowing the Scriptures
      nor the power of God.
  30  For in the resurrection 
      they neither marry nor are given in marriage,
      but are like angels of God in heaven.
    ...>>

James 1:22-25
  22 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only,
      deceiving yourselves.
  23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer,
      he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror;
  24 for he obeserves himself, goes away, 
      and immediately forgets what kind of man he was.
  25 But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty
      and continues in it, 
      and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work,
      this one will be blessed in what he does.

Psalms 19:10
  10 More to be desired are they than gold,
    Yea, than much fine gold;
    Sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

Revelations 10:9-10
  9 So I went to the angel and said to him,
    "Give me the little book."
    And he said to me,
    "Take and eat it; 
    and it will make your stomach bitter,
    but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth."
  10 Then I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it,
    and it was sweet as honey in my mouth.
    But when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter
  
Exekiel 2:9-3:9
  9 Now when I looked, there was a hand stretched out to me;
    and behold, a scroll of a book was in it.
  10 Then He spread it before me; 
    and there was writing on the inside and on the outside,
    and written on it were lamentations and mourning and woe.
  1 Moreover He said to me,
    "Son of man, eat what you find; eat this scroll, 
    and go, speak to the house of Israel"
  2 So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that scroll.
  3 And He said to me,
    "Son of man, feed your belly, 
    and fill your stomach with this scroll that I give you"
    So I ate, 
    and it was in my mouth like honey in sweetness.
  4 Then He said to me: 
    "Son of man, go to the house of Israel and speak with My words to them.
  5 For you are not sent to a people of unfamiliar speech
    and of hard language,
    but to the house of Israel,
    not to many people of unfamiliar speech and of hard language
    whose words you cannot understand.
    Surely, had I sent you to them,
    they would have listened to you.
  7 But the house of Israel will not listen to you,
    because they will not listen to Me;
    for all the house of Israel are impudent and hard-hearted
  8 Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces,
    and your forehead strong against their foreheads.
  9 Like adamant stone, harder than flint, I have made your forehead;
    do not be afraid of them, nor be dismayed at their looks,
    though they are a rebellious house/"
