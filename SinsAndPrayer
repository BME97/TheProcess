//What is it
Isaiah 59:1-3
  1 Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened,
    That it cannot save;
    Nor His ear heavy,
    That it cannot hear.
  2 But your iniquities have separated you from your God;
    And your sins have hidden His face from you,
    So that He will not hear.
  3 For your hands are defiled with blood,
    And your fingers with iniquity;
    Your lips have spoken lies,
    Your tongue has muttered perversity.
  
  4 No one calls for justice,
    Nor does any plead for truth.
    They trust in empty words and speak lies;
    They conceive evil and bring forth iniquity.
  5 They hatch viper's eggs and weave the spider's web;
    He who eats of their eggs dies,
    And from that which is crushed a viper breaks out
  6 Their webs will not become garments, 
    Nor will they cover themselves with their works;
    Their works are works of iniquity,
    And the act of violence is in their hands.
  7 Their feet run to evil,
    And they make haste to shed innocent blood;
    Their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity;
    Wasting and destruction are in their paths.
  8 The way of peace they have not known,
    And there is no justice in their ways;
    They have made themselves crooked paths;
    Whoever takes that way shall not know peace.


James 1:13-15
  13 Let no one say when he is tempted,
    "I am tempted by God";
    for God cannot be tempted by evil, 
    nor does He Himself tempt anyone.
  14 But each one is tempted when 
    he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed.
  15 Then, when desire has conceived, 
    it gives birth to sin,
    when it is full-grown,
    brigns forth death.

  16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brethren.
  17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above,
    and comes down from the Father of lights,
    with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning.
  18 Of His own will He brought us forth 
    by the word of truth,
    that we might be a kind of firstfruits of His creatures.


Romans 3:23
  23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,

//sins of Commission (instruction/command)
Galatians 5:19-21
  19 Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are:
    adultery,
    fornication,
    uncleaness,
    lewdness,
  20 idolatry,
    sorcery,
    hatred,
    contentions,
    jealousies,
    outbursts of wrath,
    selfish ambitions,
    dissensions,
    heresies,
  21 envy,
    murders,
    drunkness,
    revelries,
    and the like;
    of which i tell you beforehand, 
    just as I also told you in time past,
    that those who practice such things 
    will not inherit the kingdom of God.


Mark 7:20-23
  20 And He said,
    << What comes out of a man, that defiles a man.
  21  For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed 
      evil thoughts,
      adulteries,
      fornications,
      murders,
  22  thefts,
      covetousness,
      wickedness,
      deceit,
      lewdness,
      an evil eye,
      blasphemy,
      pride,
      foolishness.
  23 All these evil things come from within and defile a man.>>


James 4:17
  17 Therefore, to him who knows to do good and does not do it,
    to him it is sin

//Attitude towards sin
Luke 18:9-14
  9 Also He spoke this parable to some who 
    trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:
  10 << Two men went up to the temple to pray,
        one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
  11   The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself,
        'God, I thank you that I am not like other man
        - extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.
  12    I fast twice a week;
        I give tithes of all that I possess.'
  13   And the tax collector, standing afar off, 
      would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven,
      but beat his breast, saying,
      'God be merciful to me a sinner!'
  14  I tell you, this man went down to his house justified
      rather than the other;
      for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled,
      and he who humbles himself will be exalted. >>

//What He did
Colossians 2:13-15
  13 And you, being dead in your trespasses
    and the uncircumcision of your flesh,
    He has made alive together with Him,
    having forgiven you all trespasses,
  14 having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us,
    which was contrary to us.
    And He has taken it out of the way,
    having nailed it to the cross.
  15 Having disarmed principalities and powers,
    He made a public spectacle of them,
    triumphing over them in it.

//Prayer
Matthew 26:36-46
  36 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane,
    and said to the disciples,
    << Sit here while I go and pray over there.>>
  37 And He took with Him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee,
    and He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.
  38 Then He said to them,
    << My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death.
      Stay here and watch with Me >>
  39 He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying,
    << O My Father, if it is possible,
      let this cup pass from Me;
      nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will. >>
  40 Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping,
    and said to Peter,
    << What! Could you not watch with Me one hour?
  41  Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation.
      The spirit indeed is willing,
      but the flesh is weak. >>
  42 Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying
    << O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, 
      Your will be done. >>
  43 And He came and found them asleep again,
    for their eyes were heavy.
  44 So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time,
    saying the same words.
  45 Then He came to His disciples and said to them,
    << Are you still sleeping and resting?
      Behold, the hour is at hand, 
      and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
  46  Rise, let us be going.
      See, My betrayer is at hand. >>
