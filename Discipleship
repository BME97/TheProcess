Discipleship

- 1 John 1:6
 6 So we are lying if we say we have fellowship with God but go on living in spiritual darkness; we are not practicing the truth.


- Matthew 28:18-20
18 Jesus came and told his disciples, “I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. 

19 Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. 

20 Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. 

And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”


- Luke 9:23-26
23 Then he said to the crowd, “If any of you wants to be my follower, you must give up your own way, take up your cross daily, and follow me.

 24 If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it. 25 And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but are yourself lost or destroyed? 
	- [Ref: Matthew 5]

26 If anyone is ashamed of me and my message, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in his glory and in the glory of the Father and the holy angels.


- Matthew 5:11-12
11 “God blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you and say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my followers. 12 Be happy about it! Be very glad! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same way.
	- Eternal life is a gift


- Luke 14:25-33
25 A large crowd was following Jesus. He turned around and said to them, 26 “If you want to be my disciple, you must, by comparison, hate everyone else—your father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even your own life. Otherwise, you cannot be my disciple.27 And if you do not carry your own cross and follow me, you cannot be my disciple.

28 “But don’t begin until you count the cost. For who would begin construction of a building without first calculating the cost to see if there is enough money to finish it? 29 Otherwise, you might complete only the foundation before running out of money, and then everyone would laugh at you. 30 They would say, ‘There’s the person who started that building and couldn’t afford to finish it!’

31 “Or what king would go to war against another king without first sitting down with his counselors to discuss whether his army of 10,000 could defeat the 20,000 soldiers marching against him? 32 And if he can’t, he will send a delegation to discuss terms of peace while the enemy is still far away. 
33 So you cannot become my disciple without giving up everything you own.
	- Value what is God's will 
	- Consequences


- John 13:34-35
 34 So now I am giving you a new commandment: Love each other. Just as I have loved you, you should love each other. 35 Your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples.”
	- Prayer is a big way to show love
	- Important commandment


- Colossians 3:16-17
16Let the message about Christ, in all its richness, fill your lives. 

Teach and counsel each other with all the wisdom he gives. 

Sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs to God with thankful hearts. 

17 And whatever you do or say, do it as a representative of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through him to God the Father.
	- Being present for one another
	- Learning from each other


- Phillipians 2:12-13
12 Dear friends, you always followed my instructions when I was with you. And now that I am away, it is even more important. 

Work hard to show the results of your salvation, obeying God with deep reverence and fear. 

13 For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him.


- John 15:7-8
7 But if you remain in me and my words remain in you, you may ask for anything you want, and it will be granted! 
8 When you produce much fruit, you are my true disciples. This brings great glory to my Father.


- Galatians 5:20
22 But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives: love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 23 gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!
