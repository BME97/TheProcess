1 John 1:6
  6 If we say that we have fellowship with Him,
    and walk in darkness,
    we lie and do not practice the truth.
  
  7 But if we walk in the light as He is in the light,
    we have fellowship with one another,
    and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son 
    cleanses us from all sin.
    
          8 If we say that we have no sin,
            we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
          9 If we confess our sins,
            He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins
            and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
          10 If we say that we have not sinned,
            we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us

*Matthew 28:18-20
  18 And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying,
    << All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.
  19  Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations,
      baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,
  20  teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you;
      and lo, I am with you always,
      even to the end of the age. >>
      Amen. 

----------------------------------------------------------------

*Luke 9:23-26
  23 Then He said to them all,
    << If anyone desires to come after Me, 
      let him deny himself,
      and take up his cross daily,
      and follow Me.
        [Acts 20:24}
            24 But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself,
              so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the LORD Jesus,
              to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.
  24  For whoever desires to save his life
      will lose it,
      but whoever loses his life for My sake
      will save it.
  25  For what profit is it to a man 
      if he gains the whole world,
      and is himself destroyed or lost?
  26  For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, 
      of him the Son of Man will be ashamed 
      when He comes in His own glory, and in His Father's, and of the holy angels.
  
  27  But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who shall not taste death
      till they see the kingdom of God. >>


Matthew 5:11-12
    <<...
  11    Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you,
        and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake.
  12    Rejoice and be exceedingly glad,
        for great is your reward in heaven,
        for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. 
      ...>> 


*Luke 14:25-33
  25 Now great multitudes went with Him.
    And He turned and said to them, 
  26 << If anyone comes to Me and does not hate 
        his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters,
        yes, and his own life also,
        he cannot be My disciple.
  27    And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me
        cannot be My disciple.
  28    For which of you, intending to build a tower,
        does not sit down first and count the cost,
        whether he has enough to finish it
  29    - lest, after he has laid the foundation,
        and is not able to finish,
        all who see it begin to mock him,
  30    saying,
          'This man began to build and was not able to finish?'
  31    Or what king, going to make war against another king,
        does not sit down first and consider
        whether he is able with 10k to meet him who comes against him with 20k?
  32    Or else, while the other is still a great way off,
        he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace.
  33    So likewise, whoever of you does not forsake all that he has
        cannot be My disciple.
     ...>>

*John 13:34-35
    <<...
  33  Little children,
      I shall be with you a little while longer.
      You will seek Me;
      and as I said to the Jews,
        'Where I am going, you cannot come'
      so now I say to you.
  34  A new commandment I give to you,
      that you love one another;
      as I have loved you,
      that you also love one another.
  35  By this all will know that you are My disciples,
      if you have love for one another. >>


Colossians 3:16
  16 Let the word of Christ 
    dwell in you richly in all wisdom,
    teaching and admonishing one another
    in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
    singing with grace in your hearts to the LORD.

  17 And whatever you do in word or deed,
    do al in the name of the LORD Jesus,
    giving thanks to God the Father through Him.


Philippians 2:12-13
  12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed,
    not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence,
    work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;
  13 for it is God who works in you
    both to will and to do for His good pleasure.


John 15:7-8
  7 If you abide in Me,
    and My words abide in you,
    you will ask what you desire,
    and it shall be done for you.
  8 By this My Father is glorified,
    that you bear much fruit;
    so you will be My disciples.


Galatians 5:22-23
  22 But the fruit of the Spirit is
    love, 
    joy, 
    peace, 
    longsuffering, 
    kindness, 
    goodness, 
    faithfulness, 
  23 gentleness, 
    self-control.
    Against such there is no law.

  24 And those who are Christ's
    have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
  25 If we live in the Spirit,
    let us also walk in the Spirit.
  26 Let us not become conceited,
    provoking one another,
    envying one another.

John 8:30-32
  30 As He spoke these words,
    many believed in Him.
  31 Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him,
    << If you abide in My word,
      you are My disciples indeed.
  32  And you shall know the truth,
      and the truth shall make you free. >>


Hebrews 11:24-26
  24 By faith Moses, when he became of age,
    refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
  25 choosing rather to 
    suffer affliction with the people of God
    than to
    enjoy the passing pleasures of sin,
  26 esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches
    than the treasures in Egypt; 
    for he looked to the reward.


Mark 1:16-20
  16 And as He walked by the Sea of Galilee,
    He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea;
    for they were fishermen.
  17 Then Jesus said to them,
    << Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men. >>
  18 They immediately left their nets and followed Him.
  19 When He had gone a little farther from there,
    He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,
    who also were in the boat mending their nets.
  20 And immediately He called them,
    and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants,
    and went after Him.

Luke 11:1
  1 Now it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place,
    when He ceased, that one of His disciples said to Him,
    "Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples" 

(part of prayer:)
----------------------------------------------------------------
2 So He said to them,
    << When you pray, say:
        Our Father in heaven,
        Hallowed be Your name.
        Your kingdom come.
        Your will be done
        On earth as it is in heaven.
  3     Give us day by day our daily bread.
  4     And forgive us our sins,
        For we also forgive everyone who is indebted to us.
        And do not lead us into temptation,
        But deliver us from the evil one. >>
